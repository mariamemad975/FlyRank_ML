## 0. Abstract

Can machine learning reliably detect web pages at risk of search-ranking decay so that content teams can prioritize reviews? Using approximately 79 million rows of FlyRank search and engagement data, the study represents each content page through signals including click-through rate, search impressions, and query-footprint characteristics. A binary classification model was trained and tuned for high recall because missing a genuinely decaying page is more costly than reviewing a healthy page. The model achieved 81.9% accuracy and 97% recall for decaying pages, outperforming the 50.1% majority-class baseline. The resulting decay flag and probability score are used to create a prioritized human-review queue, helping SEO and content teams identify potentially declining pages before performance losses become more difficult to reverse.


## 1. Problem framing

What decision does this support? Name the unit of analysis (page, client, day…), the output
(score, rank, cluster, report), the action a human takes from it, and the cost of a wrong
call. Why does data/ML help here at all?

## 2. Data safety

Which data you used and which columns you deliberately excluded (and why). Leakage risks you
considered — especially label-derived fields (`trend_direction`, `trend_pct`) and pseudonymous
IDs (grouping only, never features). Confirm nothing client-identifying appears anywhere in
`work/`.

## 3. Baseline

The transparent rule or score you built first. Why it's a fair comparison, and its numbers on
the same data and metric as your model.

## 4. Model / analysis

Your method and why it fits the lane. The exact feature list (and what you left out on
purpose). The target or proxy definition, in one sentence.

## 5. Evaluation

Your split (grouped by client? time-aware?) and why. Metrics, model vs baseline **on the same
split**. What the errors look like — a short error analysis beats a big metric table.

## 6. Interpretation

What the model/clusters actually found. Feature importances or cluster profiles in plain
words. Surprises and negative results — a well-understood "no effect" is a valid result.

## 7. Recommendation

The ranked actions or decisions your output supports, and how a FlyRank editor would use them
tomorrow. State your confidence and the limits explicitly.

## 8. Reproducibility

The exact commands to re-run everything from a fresh clone, your random seeds, and your
environment (`pip freeze` highlights or `requirements.txt` deltas). If you claim a sealed or
holdout evaluation, two things must be committed: the cell/script that builds the sealed
frame, and the metrics file it produced — "evaluated once, blind" should be checkable from
your repo, not taken on faith.

## 9. Acknowledgments & data credit

One short section at the bottom of the deployed paper: "Built on the FlyRank ML Internship
dataset" **linking to https://flyrank.ai**. Crediting your data source is standard research
practice — and it's on the capstone's required-section list, so a paper without it isn't done.
